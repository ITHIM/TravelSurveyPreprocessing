#' collected if they're longer than 2 blocks (**File1** page 7).

#' 2. *Collection:* Trips collected in this survey correspond to those made the 
#' day of reference, i.e., the day and night before the survey (last 24 hours) 
#' (page 25, Modulo III from **File2**).

#' ### Importing datasets
#' In file "DataDictionary.xlsx" there's a data dictionary. This data dictionary
#' was taken from https://datosabiertos.metropol.gov.co/dataset/encuesta-origen-destino-2017-datos-por-viajes
#' 
#' I ran everything local because it is faster, but if someone wants to run this
#' script, then only the path needs to be changed.
#' Information about households, people and trips are in the same file but in 
#' different sheets.
# V-Drive folder
#path <- "V:/Studies/MOVED/HealthImpact/Data/Country/Colombia/Medellin/Travel/EOD2017/"
# Local folder
path <- "C:/Users/danie/Documents/Daniel_Gil/Consultorias/2021/Cambridge/Data/Colombia/Medellin/Trips/"

#+ warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, cache=TRUE
# Households (hh)

trips <- trips[rowSums(is.na(trips)) != ncol(trips), ] # Removing empty rows

#' ### Number households and people
#' The first thing to do is verify that the number of households and Macrozones 
#' in the dataset are the same to what is mentioned in page 5 of **File1**.
nrow(hh)
length(unique(hh$NOM_MACROZONA))
#' These values are the same as reported. However I could not replicate any 
#' other result because these datasets don't have sampling weights, and every 
#' number in **File1** was estimated using them.
#' 
#' ### Number of hh in trip dataset
#' First I have to make sure that there are no duplicates in the hh dataset.
length(unique(hh$ID_HOGAR)) == nrow(hh)

#' Since this is ok, then I have to see whether the number of hh in the trip 
#' dataset is the same that in the hh dataset
length(unique(trips$ID_HOGAR)) == nrow(hh)
hh$ID_HOGAR[!hh$ID_HOGAR %in% c(trips$ID_HOGAR)]

#' These households don't have trips recorded. Here's a couple of cases 
#' (randomly chosen)
trips[trips$ID_HOGAR == "3001827",]
trips[trips$ID_HOGAR == "305914",]

#' Since there are hh without trips, I want to see whether there are trips 
#' without hh information. The following output suggest that it's not the case.
trips$ID_HOGAR[!trips$ID_HOGAR %in% c(hh$ID_HOGAR)]
#' 
#' ### Number of people in trip dataset
#' Check first that there are no duplicates in people dataset.
people <- people %>% 
  mutate(participant_id_paste = paste(ID_HOGAR, ORDEN_MORADOR, sep = "-"))
length(unique(people$participant_id_paste)) == nrow(people) 
#' Since this is ok, then I have to see whether the number of people in the trip
#' dataset is the same that in the people dataset
trips <- trips %>% 
  mutate(participant_id_paste = paste(ID_HOGAR, ID_MORADOR, sep = "-"))

length(unique(trips$participant_id_paste)) == nrow(people)

head(people$participant_id_paste[!people$participant_id_paste %in% c(trips$participant_id_paste)], 100)

#' These people don't have trips recorded, and it must be because of
#' restrictions in the questionnaire. Here's a couple of cases (randomly
#' chosen)
trips[trips$participant_id_paste == "10804-1106",]
trips[trips$participant_id_paste == "616-50",]

#' Since there are people without trips, I want to see whether there are trips 
#' without people information. The following output suggest there is one trip
#' without personal information, and when looking for it in the people dataset
#' it doesn't appear. Therefore, these trips are going to be removed (later).
trips$participant_id_paste[!trips$participant_id_paste %in% c(people$participant_id_paste)]

people[people$ID_HOGAR == "401022" & people$ORDEN_MORADOR == "158",]

#' # **Preprocessing phase**
#' ## Filtering people from Medellin only
#' Since the survey was conducted in 10 municipalities and we are only
#' interested in Medellin, then these trips are the only ones used. I could've
#'  used the information of other municipalities, if there had been data about
#'  injuries in these locations, but unfortunately we only have injuries in
#'  Medellin.
people_v2 <- people %>% 
  inner_join(hh[,c("ID_HOGAR", "NOM_MUNICIPIO")], 
             by = "ID_HOGAR") %>% 
  filter(NOM_MUNICIPIO == "Medellin")

#' I verify that there are no duplicates in people dataset
length(unique(people_v2$participant_id_paste)) == nrow(people_v2)

#' ## Classification and translation of trip modes
#' Nowhere in the documentation says something about the process to define the
#' trip main mode of transport. I asked directly to people from Medellin and 
#' they told me there was hierarchy (like in Bogota) but they didn't send it to
#' me. As a consequence I decided to create this classification and its
#' hierarchy based on the information I have from Bogota. 
#' This is the result:
main_mode <- read_csv("Data/Standardization/Modes_by_city.csv") %>% 
  filter(City == "Medellin")
main_mode[,-c(1:3)] %>% kbl() %>% kable_classic()

#' Now with respect to trip purpose (column MOTIVO_VIAJE), I only had to
#' translate them. This is the result:
#table(trips$DESC_MOTIVO_VIAJE, trips$MOTIVO_VIAJE)
purpose <- read_csv("Data/Standardization/Purpose_by_city.csv") %>% 
  filter(City == "Medellin")
purpose[,-c(1:2)] %>% kbl() %>% kable_classic()

#' The first two columns have been taken from the dataset, and the third column
#' is the translation and classification of these motives. 
#' 
#' ## Information at stage or trip level?
#' There is information at stage level although it seems that is not enough 
#' because of the duration of each stage. The information available is about the
#' number of blocks walked before taking other mode, but there's no information
#' about minutes walked or the time spent in each stage.
#' 
#' **For this reason I conclude that even though there's information at stage**
#' **level, it's not enough to get the duration for each stage. Therefore,**
#' **I will continue working at trip level, and to get the trip mode I will**
#' **define the mode with highest priority.**
#' 
#' But first I verify there are no duplicates in trips dataset
trips <- trips %>% 
  mutate(trip_id_paste = paste(ID_HOGAR, ID_MORADOR, SEC_VIAJE, sep = "-"))
length(unique(trips$trip_id_paste)) == nrow(trips) # There are duplicates

#' In the following output I can see that there's only one duplicate and it has the same information, So I'm removing it.
which(duplicated(trips$trip_id_paste))
View(trips[which(duplicated(trips$trip_id_paste)),])
View(trips[trips$trip_id_paste == "1330375-1128-2612",])

#' Almost all the information is the same so I will remove this trip
trips <- trips[-which(duplicated(trips$trip_id_paste)),]
length(unique(trips$trip_id_paste)) == nrow(trips) # OK

#' To understand how the information was collected at stage level, I selected a
#' person at random and tried to understand what modes person took to get to its
#' destination. The person selected has ID_HOGAR = 309974, ID_MORADOR = 2 and
#' SEC_VIAJE = 6.
#' 
trips %>% filter(ID_HOGAR == "309974", ID_MORADOR == "2", 
                 SEC_VIAJE == "6") %>% 
  select(ID_HOGAR, ID_MORADOR, SEC_VIAJE, HORA_O, HORA_D, DESC_MODO_TTE_E1,
         DESC_MODO_TTE_E2, DESC_MODO_TTE_E3, DESC_MODO_TTE_E4, DEC_MODO_TTE_E5,
         DESC_MODO_TTE_E6, DESC_MODO_TTE_E7) %>% 
  mutate(HORA_O = format(HORA_O, format = "%H:%M"),
         HORA_D = format(HORA_D, format = "%H:%M")) %>%
  kbl() %>% kable_classic()

#' From this table I can see that the person started her trip at 17:00, and 
#' walked a block to get the metro. Then she took a bus (ruta integrada) to 
#' finally walk a block to get to her destination at 18:00.
#' 
#' Here it's clear that she walked before and after the public transport, and 
#' even though it says that she walked a block, we cannot know how much time she
#' spent walking. We could somehow estimate the time walked by using only
#' walking trips but for now I will use this dataset at trip level.
#' 
#' ## Row for each trip, translate trip_mode and create duration, sex and age
#' Trip dataset already has a row for each trip, so I have to create the 
#' variables I need.
